### About Me

I'm a software engineer with 6+ years of professional experience at startups. I recently quit my job to focus on learning as much as I can about Bitcoin and getting involved with the space.

If you are hiring for software engineering roles at a Bitcoin-focused company, I'm interested.

I'll be more actively searching for a role sometime in 2021 but certainly won't pass up a good opportunity should one arise before then.
